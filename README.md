Ideas for RM

- [ ] Have a repository with all the email templates we send during a cycle
- [ ] Set up a reverse schedule checklist (r√©troplanning) for a cycle (for myself)
- [ ] Write down everything we do, everyday for a cycle and turn that into documentation
- [ ] Maintain a public Json API with our release dates that would allow tools to use it? Set up a release dates dashboard with the number of weeks to the next release?
